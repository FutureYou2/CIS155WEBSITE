Satisfactory is an open-world factory-building and automation game developed by Coffee Stain Studios in which players are deployed by the fictional corporation FICSIT Inc. to industrialize a vast alien planet rich with natural resources. The core gameplay revolves around gathering raw materials such as iron, copper, and oil, then using machines to refine those resources into increasingly advanced components through carefully designed automated production lines. Players build extensive networks of conveyor belts, pipelines, vehicles, and rail systems while managing power generation from sources like coal, fuel, and nuclear energy to keep factories running efficiently. As technology tiers are unlocked, production chains become more complex, encouraging players to rethink layouts, optimize logistics, and scale their operations across large areas of the map. Exploration is also a major element, with diverse biomes, hidden crash sites, collectible items, and hostile wildlife adding variety and progression opportunities. The game supports both solo play and cooperative multiplayer, allowing teams to collaborate on massive industrial projects, experiment with creative building designs, and solve engineering challenges together. By combining sandbox creativity, resource management, and long-term planning, the game offers a highly immersive experience focused on efficiency, expansion, and the satisfaction of watching large automated systems operate seamlessly.
