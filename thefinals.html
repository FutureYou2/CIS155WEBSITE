                    Most people haven't even heard of The FINALS yet, but it's a really fun game that I highly recommend checking out!

                    The game focuses on team-based arena combat with dynamic destruction.
                    Every match feels different depending on strategy and environment. Heres what my character looks like in the game! I have a lot
					of fun playing this game with my friends and I think you would too!
